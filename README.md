# WINE_QUALITY_PREDICTION

 The Wine Quality Prediction project aims to determine the quality of wines based on specific attributes using linear regression. By training a machine learning model on a dataset comprising various wine characteristics, the model can predict the quality rating of a given wine sample. The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:
 1.Fixed acidity
 2.Volatile acidity
 3.Citric acid
 4.Residual sugar
 5.Chlorides
 6.Free sulfur dioxide
 7.Total sulfur dioxide
 8.Density
 9.pH
10.Sulfates
11.Alcohol
Based on the above features the quality of wine is predicted using linear regresion model.
